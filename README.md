## Overview
This repository contains a curated set of **10 advanced T-SQL queries** designed to extract business-critical insights from Microsoftâ€™s *Wide World Importers* (WWI) sample database.  
The script `annual_sales_queries.sql` can be used as a ready-made analytics toolkit for answering questions around yearly revenue, customer performance, product profitability, churn detection and more.

## File Structure



## Prerequisites
* SQL Server 2019 + (or Azure SQL) with the **WideWorldImporters** and **WideWorldImportersDW** databases installed.
* Sufficient privileges to create CTEs, run window functions, and use `PIVOT`.

## How to Run
1. Open SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) / Azure Data Studio.  
2. Select the **WideWorldImporters** context.  
3. Execute `annual_sales_queries.sql` as-is or copy individual queries as needed.  
4. Review result sets and adjust `WHERE` filters or date ranges to fit your reporting cycle.
